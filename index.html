            I've always been into building and creating things since childhood. One of my passions was drawing and painting. I used to watch cartoons just so I could render what I saw on TV! So, going to college at the School of Visual Arts in NYC was a no-brainer for me. My main concentration was painting, but I also took some graphic design courses. This definitely sparked my love for creating digitally as well!

            While living in Brooklyn, I collaborated on a jewelry project with Linda from Casa Vida (whose store is now located in Philly). We worked on several jewelry collections for an Indian company focused on providing jobs for women in India. We created the initial designs, and our Indian counterparts handled mass production.

          <p>
            Fast forward to now—I'm living in Philly and trying to figure out the next steps in my journey. I've always been interested in web development but wasn't sure how to approach it. I taught myself a bit of HTML through freeCodeCamp.com and wanted to learn more. In my search for further coding education, I came across LaunchCode, and here I am! I'm excited to see what the future holds for me in web development.
